# FAQ

**Why do we need yet another Java Testing Framework?**

The intent of this project is not to add yet another testing framework to the Java eco-system or simply re-invent the wheel but to fill a void. There are numerous testing framework out there but none that allow you to write Unit, Integration and System tests quickly and intuitively. Testify is built on testing best practices and we feel confident that it will help you write better
production and test code and be more productive.

**Who started the project?**

Testify was started by Sharmarke Aden late 2015 because he was not satisfied with the landscape of Jave Testing Framework. Having written HK2 Testing Framework, contributed to Cargo, and used various testing frameworks (Spring Testing Framework, Arquillian, Selenium, etc), and seen countless of ineffective "unit", "integration", and "system" tests decided there has to be a better way.

**Do you intend to support my favorite XYZ Framework?**

Testify is designed to be modular and extensible. Adding support for a new dependency injection or application framework or any feature for that matter is a fairly straight forward process. Having said that, work has to be prioritized. I will seriously consider every request and if your request is aligned with Testify's mission and vision I will add it. I am also very open to would like
contribution. Please submit a [pull request][pull-request] for features and fixes you would like to see in Testify.

**Testify only supports constructor injection, what about field and setter injection?**

Testify is an opinionated framework that adheres to and enforces OOP and testing best practice. Field and Setter injection are bad practice and demo fodder. Using them present an existential threat to the quality of your code and hampers your ability to write quality production and test code. For this reason I am afraid Testify will never support field and setter injected in your Class Under Test (CUT).

**Can my Test Class have multiple Needs?**

Absolutely! Both @RequiresResource and @RequiresContainer annotation are repeatable and your test class can require as many resources as it needs ;)

**Can my Test Class have multiple Modules**

Yes. @Module annotation is repeatable. Having said that, it is recommended that your test class only import one single module to limit the scope of the test class and maintain modularity. If you find that you need many modules you should think about refactoring.

**Isn't what you call fake really a mock? Why not call it mock?**

It is true that there is a distinction between a fake and a mock. Testify indeed conflates the two as [described][mocks-arent-stubs] by Martin Flowers. Testify considered and in fact did use `@Mock` at inception but a decision was made to change it to `@Fake` for the following reason:

- Many testing frameworks (i.e. Mockito, Powermock, etc) already have `@Mock` annotations and developers will have to make a conscious decision as to which annotation to import. This can lead to a number of issues that can slow down development.
- `@Fake` is business people friendly and we want to be as friendly as possible to a wider audience.
- `@Fake` fits nicely with `@Real` and `@Virtual` verbiage. Instances are either fake or real or virtual (delegated mock).
- Using `@Fake` is in-line with Testify's mission of being an easy to understand and easy to use testing framework.

**Docker Container based testing is eating my disk space? How do I reclaim disk space?**

- Testify tries to delete containers after each test but sometimes may not be able (i.ie the JVM is terminated in the middle of a test
case). You can manually clean up the exited containers using the following command:

{% highlight bash linenos=table %}
docker rm -v $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
{% endhighlight %}

- Docker keeps all images it pulls from the Docker registry on disk. If you are still low on disk space you can manually delete dangling Docker images (file system layer not being referenced) to create disk room. It is a good idea to use fixed version Docker images but if you want to always use the latest version of a Docker image then you may want to periodically clean up dangling images by executing the following command:

{% highlight bash linenos=table %}
docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)
{% endhighlight %}

- Docker also keeps volumes of pulled images on disk. If you are still low on disk space and are using Docker v1.19.x and above you can delete dangling volumes using the following command:

{% highlight bash linenos=table %}
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)
{% endhighlight %}
