Testify is a Java implementation of [Semantic Testing](http://semantictesting.org) specification. For users, Testify provides a common set of primatives that can be learned once and used everywhere to write test cases. For developers, Testify provides extension points to enable their software to be testable.


## Benefits

- Testify makes it painless to write unit, integration and system tests. Write simple and isolated test cases to verify your application works as expected without worrying about managing application state.
- Build reusable test components that manage their own state that can be compose to write more complex test cases.
- We don't make assumptions about your technology stack, so you can develop new features in Testify without rewriting existing code.
